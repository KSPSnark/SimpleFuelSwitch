// This config provides another example of what you can do with variant-linked
// resources. It sets up the "Shrouded" variant of the Terrier engine so that
// it includes a small amount of LFO tank capacity, while slightly increasing
// the dry mass of the part.
//
// The effect mimics the version of the Terrier that Porkjet released for his
// PartOverhauls package, in which he'd redesigned the Terrier with an integrated
// fuel tank. KSP 1.6 offers Terrier variants that include a shrouded version
// that looks a *little* bit like Porkjet's remodeling, so this config mimics that.

	//
	// "But why is this needed?", you may be wondering. "Couldn't you just
	// leave it off and it would have the same effect?"  Good question. The
	// answer is that no, that wouldn't work. If we simply left this off,
	// then the non-Shroud variants wouldn't have *any* linked resource
	// options, which is not the same thing as explicitly specifying "no
	// resources". If we did that, what would happen in gameplay is that
	// the Terrier would switch to having LFO in it when you pick the
	// Shroud variant... but if you then switch to another variant, it
	// would just leave the part alone (since there's no linked variant
	// to the other ones), and the LFO would remain behind.
	//
	// Moral of the story: If you ever equip a part with SimpleFuelSwitch
	// config, and if you decide to use the 'linked variant' feature,
	// then you should generally ensure that every single variant is
	// covered by a ModuleSwitchableResources. The wildcard is handy
	// for this.

		// like a reasonably illustrative name, so why not.  :-)
