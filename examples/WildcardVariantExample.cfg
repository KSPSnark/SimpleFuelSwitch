// This sample config demonstrates how to use a wildcard tag with linked variants.
//
// SimpleFuelSwitch installs default config that equips all the stock LFO tanks
// with the option to switch to LF-only.  It does so without regard to variants,
// meaning that it simply adds a "choose fuel type" button to the tanks' right-click
// menus.
//
// What this config here does is to further modify that config for just the FL-T800
// fuel tank.  It rejiggers the resource selection so that it's tied to the tank's
// currently selected variant. It's set up so that if the player selects the
// gray-and-orange variant, then liquid fuel will be chosen; any other variant
// will be LFO. See further comments below.

		// variants, separated by commas, if you want to have more than one variant
		// tied to the same resource selection. So, for example, if you wanted *both*
		// the gray/orange and the black/white variants to be tied to the LF-only
		// fuel option, then you could change this line to:
		// %linkedVariant = GrayAndOrange, BlackAndWhite
